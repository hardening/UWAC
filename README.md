UWAC
====

UWAC stands for Using Wayland As Client, it tries to provide a library to help porting existing 
Xlib application without using heavy toolkit that are already wayland compatible (SDL, Qt5, Gtk, ...).

UWAC tries to keep the Xlib spirit to minimize changes needed to port the application to wayland.
